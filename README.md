# ElizaApp

This project is to mimic a personality assessment test (Eliza) that uses a series of questions to find out information about the user by using the longest and shortest words from the entire session to form a random assessment sentence. Everything is logged in a file, and can be displayed in the gui after at least 1 session has been completed.
The longest words from each answer can be displayed in the order in which they were provided by the user and logged into the file. They can also be sorted and displayed alphabetically.
The program is exited by X-ing out of the application window, or hitting the end session button.
